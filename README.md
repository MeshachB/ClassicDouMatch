#  Classic Duos Match Game
A 1-player browser memory game built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Your goal is to match **iconic duos** (like Kobe & Shaq, Batman & Robin, or Kid & Play) before time runs out. Inspired by classic memory games with a hip-hop, anime, and pop culture twist.

##  How to Play

- Click two cards to flip them.
- Try to match famous duos (not identical values—**complementary pairs**).
- You have **3 minutes (180 seconds)** to match all 25 duos.
- Match all pairs before time runs out and win!
- If time runs out, it’s game over—but you can hit **"Run it back?"** to try again.

## WHY 
I chose the matching game, to be honest because i thought it wouldn't be that hard (lol it was the second option).Now that being the case im glad I didnt go past the second option the difficulty to build this game was perfect for where I am mentally for the cohort. I also found it very fun thinking of the many different duos and thought it be a fun way to display my taste in pop culture.
